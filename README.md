# 📊 SQL Challenges – Problem Solving Archive  

Welcome to my personal **SQL Challenges Repository** 🚀  
This repo is my **ongoing journey** in solving diverse SQL problems and challenges.  

It serves as a **knowledge base** and **practice hub** for:  
- 💼 Interview Preparation  
- 📚 Academic Exercises  
- 🛠️ Refining Database Skills  
- 📝 Clear, Well-Documented Query Solutions  

## 📖 What’s Inside?
- ✅ Basic SELECT queries  
- 🔗 Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- ➕ Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING)  
- 🔍 Subqueries and Nested Queries  
- 📈 Advanced Analytical Functions (Window Functions, RANK, PARTITION BY, CTEs)  

## 🧠 Problem Approach Strategy

Each SQL problem in this repository follows a structured thinking process:

1. **Understand the schema** (tables, relationships)  
2. **Identify the requirement** (filtering, aggregation, ranking, etc.)  
3. **Break the query into steps**  
4. **Use intermediate queries (CTEs/subqueries)** if needed  
5. **Optimize for readability + performance**  

## ⚡ Query Optimization Techniques

- Proper use of **indexes (conceptually understood)**  
- Avoiding unnecessary subqueries  
- Using **JOINs efficiently instead of nested queries**  
- Leveraging **window functions over complex aggregations**  
- Writing **clean and minimal queries**  

## 🧪 Query Patterns Covered

- Top N / Highest Salary problems  
- Duplicate detection  
- Running totals & cumulative sums  
- Ranking (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)  
- Gaps & Islands problems  
- Time-based analysis  
- Conditional aggregation  

## 🧩 Difficulty Levels

- 🟢 Easy → Basic queries & filtering  
- 🟡 Medium → Joins, aggregations, subqueries  
- 🔴 Hard → Window functions, complex logic, optimization  

## 📂 Solution Format

Each solution is written with:

- 📝 Problem statement  
- 💡 Query solution  
- 📖 Explanation (step-by-step logic)  
- ⏱️ Complexity insight (where applicable)  
- 📊 Sample input/output  

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible syntax)  
- Local DB / Online judges (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)  
- Query editor for testing and validation  

## 📈 Learning Roadmap

This repository is built with a progression mindset:

1. Basics → SELECT, WHERE  
2. Intermediate → JOINs, GROUP BY  
3. Advanced → Subqueries, CTEs  
4. Expert → Window functions & optimization  

## 🔍 Real-World Relevance

The problems in this repo simulate real scenarios like:

- Sales analysis  
- User activity tracking  
- Data aggregation & reporting  
- Ranking and segmentation  
- Business insights from raw data  

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

- Add unique SQL problems only  
- Maintain clean and readable queries  
- Include explanation for every solution  
- Follow consistent formatting  
- Avoid overly complex, unreadable queries  

## 🧠 Key Focus

This repository is not about writing long queries —  
it’s about writing **correct, optimized, and readable SQL**.

## 🎯 Goal

To master SQL not just for interviews,  
but for **real-world data analysis and problem solving**.
